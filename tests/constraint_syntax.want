=== Test 1: Single type variable, multiple constraints ===
Same: 42
Different: 1 vs 2
Same: hello
Different: a vs b
=== Test 2: Three constraints ===
same, hash=42
diff: 1 vs 2, hash=1
same, hash=5
diff: a vs bb, hash=1
=== Test 3: Two type variables, single constraint each ===
(42, hello)
(true, 100)
(a, b)
=== Test 4: Two type variables, one with multiple constraints ===
1 and 1 are same, also: tag
1 and 2 are different, also: true
=== Test 5: Two type variables, both with multiple constraints ===
a: 1 (=), b: a (=)
a: 1 (!=), b: a (!=)
a: 42 (=), b: x (!=)
=== Test 6: Three type variables, mixed constraints ===
[100] [a same a] [true]
[200] [a diff b] [false]
=== Test 7: Built-in traits ===
1 < 2
5 = 5
10 > 3
apple < banana
=== Test 8: Complex example ===
[5 .. 10]
[1 .. 100]
[a .. z]
=== All constraint syntax tests passed ===
